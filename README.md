We have been tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The idea is to learn about a variety of customers at Instacart and their purchasing behaviors to develop a targeted marketing strategy.


## Data

We were provided with datasets that contained all the customer information:

  - Orders
  - Orders_Products_Prior
  - Products
  - Customers
  - Departments

## Folders

The basket analysis was separated into the following folders:

   - Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
   - Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. **NOTE: This folder is not included**
   - Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
   - Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
   - Sent to client: Contains the Final Report in Excel
