# Instacart (Python)

Instcart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They have good sales historically but want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.


## Objective 
![Instacart Image](https://github.com/jayson91/Instacart-Python-/assets/104707574/9159bbd8-a1a3-4275-beeb-38f53e5475b0)


We have been tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The idea is to learn about a variety of customers at Instacart and their purchasing behaviors to develop a targeted marketing strategy.


## Data

We were provided with datasets that contained all the customer information:

  - Orders
  - Orders_Products_Prior
  - Products
  - Customers
  - Departments

## Folders

The basket analysis was separated into the following folders:

   - Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
   - Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. **NOTE: This folder is not included**
   - Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
   - Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
   - Sent to client: Contains the Final Report in Excel

### Contents: 
<b>Scripts</b>: Contains Python scripts used in data cleaning and visualization process. Scripts are numbered in the order they were created in the analysis process.
To launch to notebook, open terminal and run the command: 
<ul><li>Importing data: <pre> jupyter notebook importData.ipynb</pre></ul></li>

<b>Sent to Client</b>: 
<ul>
<li><b> Final Project</b>:  Comprehensive information pertaining to data citations, the intricacies of data wrangling and consolidation processes, as well as key business insights, is elaborated upon in the accompanying client brief.</li>
<li><b>Excel Crosstabs</b></li>
</ul>

<b>Analysis</b>: Incorporates visualizations crafted utilizing Seaborn.

<b>Results</b>: The analysis and profiling of data were systematically conducted to extract pivotal demographic insights concerning the Instacart consumer base. These insights served as the cornerstone for formulating strategic business recommendations. A detailed exposition of these recommendations can be found in the project summary.

<b>Limitations</b>:The project's nature presents challenges in grasping the context around the dataset and its business insights. Additionally, limitations in available computing power posed difficulties in conducting seamless visual analysis on the fully completed dataset. As a workaround, data visuals were crafted using subsets of data, as documented in the available Python scripts

<b>Tools</b>: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Excel.

<b>Skills</b>: Data Wrangling and Merging, Derving Variables, Grouping Data, Aggregating Data, Reporting in Excel, Population Flows, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Story Telling, Presentation, Data Visualization.
